* Split SWIG generation off into its own task

  Right now it's kind of just assumed in extconf.rb,
  it really is conceptually a different thing.

* Create separate SWIG generation for XML

  This will facilitate FFI binding generation for
  secondary notcurses-ffi backend.

* Add FFI generator task and gems to bundle

* Clean up TypeMaps if possible

  They hurt my brain so, last on the agenda.
